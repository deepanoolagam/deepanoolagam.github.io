FOREWORD
Prof.N.Dharmarajan, M.A., D.Litt.,
Professor of English (Retd.)
</p>
<p>
Jawaharlal Nehrus 125th Birth Anniversary was
celebrated in India recently. In 1978 Thiru.Veeeraiyan sent
his Tamil poems on Nehru and requested me to write a
Foreword to the poems. Prof. M. Rajendren, poet and
publisher with whom I was in daily contact also urged
me.
</p>
<p>
I wrote the Foreword in Tamil and received
copies of Veeraiyans booklet.
</p>
<p>
Subsequently I received an invitation from
Progrees Publishers Moscow to join the Tamil Section
as Translator. I joined the international publishing house
in September 1980. I lived in Moscow for eight years
(1980-88)
</p>
<p>
I translated Karl Marx, Lenin, Pushkin, Leo
Tolstoy and some other writers.
</p>
<p>
It was exciting to live in a multi-storied flat near
Kremlin and travel by the under ground train to my office.
</p>
<p>
One day I was requested to translate a biography
of Jawaharlal Nehru by the Soviet historians, Drs, Gorev
and Zimyanin. My translation sold 40,000 copies in Tamil
Nadu which was a record for a translated biography. In
1993. I translated Nehru - Years of struggle,edited by
Arjun Dev for the National Book Trust, New Delhi.
</p>
<p>
I read Nehrus auto - biography as a student in the
1950's and became his admirer.
</p>
<p>
Nehru was a poem, a promise and a prophecy. He
gave millions of Indians Faith and Hope and Nehru dominated
the political scene in India.
</p>
<p>
After the First General Election a dozen communists
were elected to the Lok Sabha. Coms. A.K.
Gopalan, Ravi Narayana Reddi, Hiren Mukerjee, Indrajit
Gupta entered the Parliament as militant fighters and opposed
Nehru vigorously. In the Rajya Sabha Coms.
P.Sundarayya,Bhupesh Gupta and Parvathi Krishnan were
equally unsparing in their attacks on the Congress Party.
</p>
<p>
In the heat of the debate, Hiren Mukerjee taunted
Nehru as a minor poet who has missed his vocation.
In any other country in the Third World the speaker would
have been arrested and tortured. But Nehru took it in his
stride.
</p>
<p>
Later he invited Hiren Mukerjee for break- fast at
his residence.The guests included some journalists and Congress
leaders. When Nehru died in 1964 after a short illness
Hiren Mukerjee was overcome with grief. He took up his pen and wrote a book, The Gentle Colossus in less than two
weeks.
</p>
<p>
Similarly Rajaji's criticisms of Nehru after he
started the Swatantra Party hurt Nehru. But he felt that
Rajajis criticism of the Permit- License- Quota Raj
was nothing compared to the treachery of the Chinese
leaders.
</p>
<p>
When Nehru was alive the Socialist Party Leader
Dr. Lohia joined the Rightist forces in attacking him.
When Nehru died Lohia said He led us with a sensitive
charm when we were young.
</p>
<p>
Dr.S.Radhakrishnan said:  He was an earnest of
an age to come,the age of world men with World Vision
</p>
<p>
In the condolence meeeting held in the U.N.O. the
delegate who represented the African continent said
"Nehru was the sculptor of the ethics of our part of humanity".
</p>
<p>
In the 1980s in Moscow. I read Dr. S.Gopals biography
of Nehru (3 Vols.) It is a splendid portrait of a
great Indian and should be translated into some of the
major Indian Languages. The Nehru Memorial Fund
should take necessary steps.
</p>
<p>
I am very thankful to Thiru Veeraiyan for requesting
me to write the Foreword for this booklet.He contacted
me in 1978 and has again contacted me in 2014,on the eve of my 80th birthday.
</p>
<p>
By Gods grace I am alive . I wish him long life
and happiness.
</p>    
<p>
I hope his booklet of poems on Nehru will be
read and appreciated by all.
