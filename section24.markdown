Jinnah in the congress party
a senior to you
not pleased with you
being in the forefront.
</p>
<p>
Even after becoming
the undisputed leader of Pakistan
he did not forget it.
</p>
<p>
The Politician was always a politician
but the poet was different.
The great Iqpal
was always very fond of you
</p>
<p>
Sheik Abdulla,
the lion of Kashmir
even though imprisoned by you
became overwhelmed with grief
when you left the world.
</p>
<p>
In faith and sprit
nobody was more closer than you
to the Mahatma Gandhi
who paid the price with his life
for the Hindu -Muslim unity.
</p>
<p>
His nomination of you
as his successor
was a well considered move.
</p>
<p>
In the first opportunity available
in the late seventies
the Godses prayed
the Gandhis name
Oh Jawaharlal,
against you.
