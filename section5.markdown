As the Prime minister,
you, at the helm of affairs,
were bound to face
problems, challenges and also
conspiracies old and new.
</p>
<p>
In the country
not all but in large numbers
politicians wedded to profit,
bureaucrats looking down upon
the common people,
media persons for their personal and
paymastersÂ’' interest
and also
national leaders,
aspiring to be partners with
industrialists
to compensate their past sacrifices.
</p>
<p>
Within the party itself
conservatives always not for your
pro-people programmes.
</p>
<p>
In the world
the powerful western countries
and particularly the U.S.A.
targeted you,as the representative of the third world
developing countries.
</p>
<p>
You were cornered but not isolated
as was Abimanyu, the son of Arjuna
in the battle field .
</p>
<p>
Oh, Jawaharlal,
the people of India were always with you.
