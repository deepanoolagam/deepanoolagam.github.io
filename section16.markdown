India's
Parliamentary democracy
is the most excellent in the world.
</p>
<p>
Under the able leadership of
Dr.Ambethkar,
the drafting committee
did a wonderful job
in drafting the constitution.
</p>
<p>
As a model
the parliamentary democracy
of England
was preferred to the
presidential form of the government
of the U.S.A.
</p>
<p>
The three divisions,
in the Indian constitution
the legislative, the executive
and the judiciary
are well balanced.
</p>
<p>
The parliamentary democracy
had been well settled here
- well settled once for all
and not to be unsettled anymore
by any force -
in the Indian Republic's
first decade itself,
because of you
being the executive head
and also the other parliamentarians
in no way inferior to
the great Edmund Burke
who impeached Warren Hasting.
</p>
<p>
The right to disagree and criticise
is the very back bone of the
parliamentary system.
</p>
<p>
In upholding this fundamental right
you were in league with
John Milton, the greatest English poet
and the Latin secretary of
Oliver Cromwell.
</p>
<p>
At a stage
Hitler was glorified
in England itself.
</p>
<p>
But sensing his intention
earlier than others
you had forewarned that
he was going
to endanger democracy.
</p>
<p>
You, a freedom fighter
turned down the offer
to meet Mussolini,
the Italian dictator
while going through his country.
</p>
<p>
You did not tolerate
the enemies of democracy
at any cost
at any time.
</p>
<p>
At the same time
if crossed the limit in words
in the heat of debate,
you did not hesitate
in extending an apology.
</p>
<p>
The thought of dictatorship
and the other anti-democratic
tendencies
did not dare to enter
even into your dream.
</p>
<p>
Even though no shortage
in the number of politicians in India
in declaring themselves or their masters
as the guardians of democracy,
the lively democrate sprit
in your name and fame here
Oh! Jawaharlal
shines brightly forever.
