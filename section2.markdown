Non Â– Violence,
an expression of universal kindness
also an Indian religious practice
was converted into a formidable weapon
by a wizard Gandhi,
-a past master in the art of
people uprising.
Socialism was approached
in the logical straight line
without any wavering
by Lenin, a revolutionary
in the real sense of the term.
</p>
<p>
In the battle field itself
Arjuna, the greatest epic warrior,
was torn by emotions
involving human relations.
You were also in the same boat
at times.
</p>
<p>
Gandhiji,
who fought and
conquered human instincts.
Lenin,
whom the Mahatma himself
called a Mahan.
Both of them
have been more regarded
and respected than you. But,
in spite of your shortcomings
Oh, Jawaharlal,
it is you dearer to the simple heart.
