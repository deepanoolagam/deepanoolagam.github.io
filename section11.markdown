Your heavy investment plan
for education in general,
for science and technology in particular
" a wrong priority in a poor country "
contested the doom - sayers.
</p>
<p>
Undeterred
you pursued your programmes
and
personally requested
Homi Bhaba and other scientists
to help in the nation building.
</p>
<p>
Of all the developing countries
India became the only one
the science oriented.
</p>
<p>
In the past,
India was unaware of the
Agrarian Industrial revolutions.
No other alternative for it
under the foreign rule.
</p>
<p>
Presently
India is in the forefront of the
Third Revolution or
Wave as it is called.
</p>
<p>
Now it is an atomic power,
also an emerging super - power
with mounting invisible exports
in the twenty first century
because its army of
trained scientists
has won the day for India.
</p>
<p>
Your fore-thought and vision
leads not India alone
but all the developing countries
Oh Jawaharlal,
from darkness to light.
