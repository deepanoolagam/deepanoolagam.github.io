Well ahead of others,
you were aware of HitlerÂ’'s intentions
but failed to read the Chinese scheme.
They attacked India in 1962.
</p>
<p>
Under the cloak of communism
they were not only nationalist
but also empire building fanatics
as you were an internationalist
to a fault.
</p>
<p>
Their socialist slogans,
the age old cultural relations between the
two countries
and above all
your good intention about them
clouded your reasoning .
</p>
<p>
A temporary set back to a great nation
India.
In the history of nations
it happens often.
</p>
<p>
In the end,
imperialism and empire - building
are going to be out of date
Oh, Jawaharlal,
as you visualized.
