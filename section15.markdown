Bharathi,
the great poet from the south,
a follower of Thilagar
in the freedom war.
</p>
<p>
The British were more
afraid of his words
than anything else.
Even those who helped him
were hunted down.
Undeterred he continued
from the territory under the French.
</p>
<p>
As a freedom fighter,
a senior to you
senior enough
to bless Gandhi in person.
</p>
<p>
Both of you,
in the same war,
-in different fronts,
-in different periods,
but in the same wave length.
</p>
<p>
Both of you
fought for freedom
-freedom from poverty
-freedom from ignorance.
</p>
<p>
Also not to forget
to discover the glorious past of India
in order to enlighten the ignorant
you attempted in your easy English
to reach the heights
attained in his rich Tamil poetry.
</p>
<p>
The mission was to destroy and create
as in the West Wind of Shelly
</p>
<p>
Legislations for reforms,
establishing key industries
to rapid up economic growth
and to become self dependent
in defence production
and many other things.
</p>
<p>
In passing the Hindu Law Bill
you were really
right in the foot-steps of Bharathi.
</p>
<p>
His passion for woman's education
and emancipation
cannot be matched
by anybody else,
other than you,
to an extent.
</p>
<p>
India belongs to the Indians one and all
and all the Indians should be equal
to one another in importance.
</p>
<p>
This Bharathi's ideal
shines as the North Star
to guide the direction and actions
</p>
<p>
Even though not known to each other
your measures and steps
were in the same direction
O...Jawaharlal,
laid down by Bharathi.
